### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My real name is Jaden, but you can call me [Rocket](https://rocketprogrammer.me).

I self-taught myself programming by modifying the source code for a Disney game called Disney's Toontown Online.

Nowadays, I have been working on [Sunrise Games](https://sunrise.games), a project aimed at writing servers for various defunct games.
